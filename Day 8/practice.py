"""Area Calculation Exercise"""

# You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall. 
# Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

# number of cans = (wall height x wall width) Ã· coverage per can.


### CODE ###

# #Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# import math

# def paint_calc(height, width, cover):
#     total_cans = math.ceil((height * width) / cover)

#     print(f"You'll need to buy {total_cans} of paint.")

# #Write your code above this line ðŸ‘†
# # Define a function called paint_calc() so that the code below works.   

# # ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
# test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
# test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
# coverage = 5

"""Prime number exercise"""

# Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by itself and 1.

# You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

# #Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

#     num = number // 2
#     isNotPrime = False
